TODO:
- Copy the features of the Meakashi updater
	- This is a simple menu that lets you choose which part of the game patch to update.
	- (Refactor code to make it so I just supply a url to a function and it extracts the stuff to the StreamingAssets folder? I would do 4 of this function call for the complete instillation)

Done:
- Make build file for Linux
- Load URLs from file
	- Load URLs from the Windows installer batch file.
- Zip extraction using 7zip on Windows and p7zip otherwise.
- Move extracted files
- Auto game path detection
	- This will include home path detection for Linux

Bonus:
- Make build file for mac??
